<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>Who doesn't enjoy a good Tim Burton film? He never fails by providing clay like animation for our enjoyment.

<h3>B.A.P.S.</h3>
<p>This is the only film where I've seen Halle Berry play some ghetto chic, which she plays awesomely, by the way. It truly is a funny movie!</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>I like this movie because my daughter likes it alot. Plus, it still is a pretty good movie even if she didn't like it. But it proves that my daughter has good taste, like her mother!</p>
